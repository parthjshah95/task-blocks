# Task-blocks (Web)
Solve the puzzle of life. Managing your life is now as simple as solving a jigsaw puzzle. Think of it as Trello, but with more fun and open source.

Based on blockly: https://developers.google.com/blockly/

## Why this project exists
The web is full of task managers. However, no open source app is good enough. The good ones are paid (or at least 'freemium' wherein all the good stuff is paid.)
This project is an attempt to change that. At worst, this would be my own custom assistant to manage my time, with all the features I could ever imagine (irl the ones I actually come around to implement). 
At the positive extreme of the spectrum, this would be a modern, open source time management tool free for all to use, with a thriving ecosystem of plugins and addons.

Does it lack a feature you would love? You are welcome to implement it yourself! Or leave a comment on the issue tracker.
